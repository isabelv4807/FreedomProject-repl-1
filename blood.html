<p class="seperation">Blood evidence is any form of blood found at the crime scene.It can help scientists identify the suspect because of the DNA found in the blood sample. Blood can show how the person was killed and the method used to kill them depending of the way blood appears.There are two types of blood dried and liquid which can be collected from a pool of blood or from cloth using a gauze or sterile cloth. When the sample is collected it has to be dried then frozen within 48 hours or else it can become useless. Blood samples are very fragile and if it isn't stored under the right conditions it won't be useful anymore. Since sometimes there is little blood it is crucial that it is properly stored. For dried blood stains the object it is on must be packaged and labeled and an investigator will analyze it either by cutting it out. It is important that everything is packaged because it can become contaminated making it useless. They can also use flakes to collect the dry blood. Whatever method used to collect any type of blood must be done properly or else i will become useless which is unideal due to the crucial and importance of the evidence.</p> <a href="index.html">Click here to go home</a>
