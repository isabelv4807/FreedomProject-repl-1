   <p class="seperation">Fingerprints can help find the suspect by comparing the fingerprints used in the crime scene to other peoples fingerprints. This can be done via a computer system that contains names with the assorted finger prints. Fingerprints can be made by sweat, oil, and dirt from friction ridges and can be found on smooth surfaces in a crime scene. Fingerprint experts use powder and chemicals to find fingerprints at a crime scene. Powder helps find fingerprints at a crime scene because it makes the fingerprints more visible by the powder adhering to the oil and sweat. They place the powder evenly on the surface of where they are looking for fingerprints and it shows up.Everyone is born with unique fingerprints, even twins do not have the same fingerprints, which makes fingerprints more useful at crime scenes.</p><a href="index.html">Click here to go home</a>
