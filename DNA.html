<p class="seperation">Dna evidence appear in many different ways such as blood, hair and saliva. It helps the scientists collect and analyze the evidence. DNA is so similar from person to person that the slightest difference can be enough to identify someone.By extracting data from one person scientist can create a “DNA” profile. Samples of DNA are obtained and used to identify people and can be compared to profiles in a database. DNA is important in cases for people like lawyers because it is the most accurate form of identification . Two forms of DNA that can be analyzed are Nuclear DNA (DNA from the nucleus) and Mitochondrial DNA (Y-chromosome analysis).  Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism is used to analyze larger fragments of data and analyzes the length of repeating bases in strands of DNA. DNA is also needs to be dissolved in a specific enzyme that helps break the DNA at specific points. When uncontaminated DNA is too small for this method Short Tandem Repeat Analysis is used. This type of analysis can use small amounts of data because through the process of Polymerase Chain Reaction  they can create copies of the data to get the necessary amount then scientist look at how many times base pairs repeat at a specific location (2,3,4,5). Investigators have found that base pairs of four or five are the ones that are accurate. Other types of analyses are Y-Marking analysis (analysis of the Y chromosome),Mitochondrial DNA Analysis.</p> <a href="index.html">Click here to go home</a>
