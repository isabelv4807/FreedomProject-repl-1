# FreedomProject-repl-1

Context
The “Freedom Project” for SEP10 is all about creating a website about a topic of our choosing and incorporating different skills we have learned in the class in order to build the website. We were able to choose a topic we liked at the beginning of the year and it was followed by research on the said topic then lessons on the different skills we needed in order to make the website about this topic. The purpose of this blog is to document my process as I am coding the website, learning new skills, and learning on my own.

Content
For my project, I am making a website about forensic science using Github, HTML, CSS, and LOYO. This blog will walk through my process of independently studying and making the website.

Implications
Positives of forensic science are people investigating crimes and can crack cold cases faster with all the additional analysis of clues. Cases that are old and have not had a solution can now be thoroughly analyzed leading to justice for these people.
Negatives of forensic science are that since the new technology and other ways crimes are solved/analyzed are shown to the public they can help people know what mistakes not to make when they are committing a crime. This would make it harder for them to get caught and cases would go unsolved allowing for criminals to getaway.
You should learn about this topic because you get a deeper understanding of how crime scenes are investigated and the different details they look at to resolve the case. If someone were to learn about this topic they might want to become a forensic scientist or they might just be more interested in true crime cases.
