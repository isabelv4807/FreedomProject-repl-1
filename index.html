      <p> Hello my name is Isabel Velazquez, i am 16 years old and a sophmore at HSTAT.I really enjoy looking into true crime cases and therefore thought this would be a perfect topic for my freedom project. if you would like to contact me i can be reached at Isabelv4807@hstat.org<p>

  <button class="accordion3"><b>Why i made the website</b></button>
    <div class="panel3"> 
      <p> This website is my freedom project for the SEP class it is based off of the topic Forensic science and includes information on subtopics i found interesting while doing research.Since the topic of the freedom project was up to me i decided to do Forensic science because i already enjoyed learning about it so making a website gave me more of a reason to research it.<p>

  <button class="accordion3"><b>What is Forensic science</b></button>
    <div class="panel3"> 
      <p>Forensic science is science that is applied to solving illegal or criminal cases. Forensic scientists  collect, gather, and observe different types of evidence located at the crime scene or on the suspects and victims. They must acquire skills in chemistry, biology, and physics to help them analyze and critically think on the job. There are several different branches of forensic science each with their own set of skills required. Scientist in one field will not be able to do the job of another because each branch of forensic science requires different procedures and analytical skills. <p>

  <h1>DNA Evidence Preview</h1>
  <p class="">Dna evidence appear in many different ways such as blood, hair and saliva. It helps the scientists collect and analyze the evidence. DNA is so similar from person to person that the slightest difference can be enough to identify someone. </p>
